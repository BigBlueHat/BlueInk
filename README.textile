h1. BlueInk CMS

BigBlueHat began building BlueInk CMS in late 2005 from ideas gathered from previous projects, problems,
and paper sketches. Over the years it's grown into a unique and powerful CMS.

Using the current commercial Software-as-a-Service BlueInk as the conceptual prototype, we're rewriting
BlueInk into an Open Source (Apache 2.0 Licensed) CMS built on CouchDB.
