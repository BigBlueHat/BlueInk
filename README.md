# BlueInk

BlueInk began in late 2005 from ideas gathered from previous projects,
problems, and paper sketches. Over the years it grew into a unique and powerful
CMS.

Using the
[current commercial Software-as-a-Service BlueInk CMS](http://demo.blueinkcms.com/)
as the conceptual prototype, BlueInk is being rewritten into an Open Source CMS
built on Apache CouchDB and Cloudant mostly as a
[CouchApp](http://docs.couchdb.org/en/latest/couchapp/).
